# Important information!!

## WIP

This is a work in progress. It is very usable, in fact I use it in my personal configs and in one Neovim plugin with great success, but the API may change.


## Not a plugin

**This is not a Neovim plugin , it is a Haxe library to help you write neovim configurations and plugins using Haxe programming language **

## Just a mirror

This repository is, as today 2023-01-02 a mirror of my personal dotfiles. The reason is point 1 on this important information list. I am still developing this library and use it daily for my Neovim configuration, so I want the convenience of having it in my personal dotfiles repository. You can open issues on this repository, but don't try to contribute to it because this repository is automatically updated from my personal dotfiles.

# Haxe Nvim

Write your next Neovim plugin or your personal neovim configuration in Haxe and enjoy a high level language which is type safe.

This library was initially intended to be named "Nvim haxelerator" (and I may rename it at some point) because it will allow you to write Neovim plugins faster and safer.
Take advantage of the powerful Haxe compiler and turn frustrating runtime errors your users (probably your future self) will face and that will take you hours to debug into nice compilation time errors that will take you seconds to fix!
